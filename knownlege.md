1. Geometry/Mesh Data

Vertices, edges, and faces that define the shape
Multiple mesh pieces (like your tree example: trunk, branches, leaves)
Level of Detail (LOD) variations for performance optimization
Collision meshes for physics interactions

2. Materials & Shaders

Base material properties (color, roughness, metallic values)
Shader code that defines how surfaces react to light
Material parameters that can be adjusted

3. Textures

Diffuse/Albedo maps (base color)
Normal maps (surface detail)
Roughness/Smoothness maps
Metallic maps
Ambient Occlusion maps
Emissive maps (for glowing parts)
Opacity/Alpha maps (for transparency)

4. Transforms & Hierarchy

Position, rotation, scale data for each component
Parent-child relationships (trunk → branch → leaf)
Pivot points and local coordinate systems

5. Animation Data

Rigging/Skeleton (bones for character assets)
Animation clips (walk, idle, etc.)
Blend shapes/Morph targets
Procedural animation parameters (like wind affecting leaves)

6. Scripts/Logic Code

Behavior scripts (movement, interaction)
State machines
Event triggers
Physics parameters

7. Audio Components

Sound effects tied to the asset
Audio sources and their positions

8. Particle Systems

Effects like smoke, fire, sparks
Emitter configurations

9. Metadata

Asset name, tags, categories
Performance metrics
Documentation
